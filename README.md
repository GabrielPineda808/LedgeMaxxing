## Favorite Code Snippet

This is my favorite code above as it is accounting for human error.
Without proper validation and being able to ensure that the user will give you what 
you want them to enter then it can cause bugs in your program that will
cause it to crash. Ensuring that the user know when they have inputted something wrong and giving them
the ability to enter the correct input is critical to the success of your program.
